Project Description:  
This Python project will develop a workforce allocation and production scheduling system designed to optimize resource management in manufacturing environments. It will ideally leverage a flexible optimization framework that dynamically assigns workers across multiple processors, stations, and shift. Employing a complex mathematical model, the software will calculate the most efficient worker configurations, minimizing idle time and ensuring production targets are met.This Python project will develop a workforce allocation and production scheduling system designed to optimize resource management in manufacturing environments.

Challenges:

#Technical:
##-One challenge is that data for this type of model does not come easy. We have several real-world examples but the data is perhaps not generic enough for this tool. We will likely need to develop “dummy” data to develop and test this software. 
##-Optimization models can be challenging, will we be able to develop the correct script to produce an output that genuinely maximizes the output while minimizing resources and idle time ratio?
#Process:
##-Working in a group of two on a complicated project with a short timeline will require clear and open communication;
##-Roles and tasks must be defined and understood by both parties; and
##-R&D projects have constant changes as new information is received. We will need to be agile and able to pivot quickly considering the short timeline. 
#Team and Skills:
##-We will both need to understand each-other’s strengths and divvy up tasks that align with those strengths. However, we will both need to share the development tasks regardless of varying levels of technical skillset. This will require strong communication, trust, and dependability.
