# CAS502Project
Cross Training Queuing System

Team Members: Zack Weber & Guy McFall

Project Description:
This Python project will develop a workforce allocation and production scheduling system designed to simulate and optimize resource management in manufacturing environments. It will ideally leverage a flexible framework to both dynamically assign, simulate, and optimize worker assignments across multiple processors, stations, and shifts. The primary objective is to load, simulate, and save the simulation history, results, and statistics for production systems with workers and resource constraints. Our stretch goals are to employ a mathematical model, where the software will calculate the most efficient worker configurations, minimize idle time and ensure production targets are met without having to run the simulation to search through each configuration directly.

Challenges:

Technical:
-Creating a consistent data structure for loading and saving the details of the production system can be complicated because these production systems can have lots of complex features, interactions, and requirements.
-One challenge is that data for this type of model does not come easy. We have several real-world examples but the data is perhaps not generic enough for this tool. We will likely need to develop “dummy” data to develop and test this software.
-Optimization models can be challenging, will we be able to develop the correct script to produce an output that genuinely maximizes the output while minimizing resources and idle time ratio?

Process:
-Working in a group of two on a complicated project with a short timeline will require clear and open communication;
-Roles and tasks must be defined and understood by both parties; and
-R&D projects have constant changes as new information is received. We will need to be agile and able to pivot quickly considering the short timeline.

Team and Skills:
-We will both need to understand each-other’s strengths and divvy up tasks that align with those strengths. However, we will both need to share the development tasks regardless of varying levels of technical skillset. This will require strong communication, trust, and dependability.
Work

Work & Communication Plan:

We each bring different strengths to the project. Zack has experience in manufacturing and is familiar with the considerations and theory behind optimizing resource management. Guy is a consultant manager with experience in developing optimization models and general project management. Pairing these skill sets together will drive the team towards successfully developing a minimum viable product.

-Weekly Meetings- We will have a standing dedicated Teams meeting once a week to discuss live progress, pending tasks, challenges, and any potential pivots.

-Backlog Management- We will employ a Teams planner to track our backlog that defines various tasks, who is responsible for what, and when are items due.

Branching Methodology:
We will follow a "Feature Branches Workflow" methodology. Our main branch will be for the primary features. We will have branches for data intake, data ingestion, data schema, output plots, output tables, and output statistics. We will split up the various branches for who is taking lead. When a feature is done and ready to be incorporated with the main branch, the non-lead partner will perform a peer review. Once accomplished, we will merge that branch with the main.
