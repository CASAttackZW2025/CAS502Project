Read through this document to understand how to properly fill out the Production System Intake form.

1. Processor- List the processors required to support this product development

2. Tasks- List all tasks required to support this product development

3. Predecessor- Identify the immediate dependency for this task to be created (i.e. to do task 2, task 1 must be completed first)

4. Standard Rate Processing Time- Document the standard time it would take a machine to perform this task

5. Variable Rate Processing Time- Identify the average time it takes a person to accomplish this task when considering complexity, skill level, etc.

6. Mixed Rate Processing Time- Identify the average time it takes to produce a batch of different products on the same production line

7. Learning Curve Percent- The percent by which production time per unit reduces for every doubling of output

8. Learning Curve Max Threshold- The point at which efficiency improvements from learning or process improvement level off

9. Minimum Processing Time Percentage- The lowest possible time required to complete a production task as a percentage of the standard processing time

10. Maximum Processing Time Percentage- The highest possible time required to complte a production task as a percentage of the standard processing time

11. Yield Percentage- The percent of usable products to total products produced

12. Resources Required- List the critical resources required for each task

13. Batch Size Required- Size of a production batch when Learning Curve Max Threshold is met

14. Unbatched Size- The largest production size that allows for customization.
