This project aims to develop a Python-based workforce management optimization system designed for manufacturing environments. The system will simulate and optimize resource allocation by dynamically assigning workers across multiple processors, stations, and shifts, with the primary goal of simulating the production system with a secondary goal of optimizing that production system efficiency. The core functionality includes uploading production system data, running simulations of manufacturing processes and worker assignments, visualizing bottlenecks, and saving comprehensive performance metrics such as throughput and takt times. While the basic implementation will focus on simulation, data representation, and ingestion, the project's stretch goals include developing a mathematical optimization model to determine optimal worker configurations without requiring extensive simulation runs.
