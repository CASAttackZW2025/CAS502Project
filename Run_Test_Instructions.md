# Test Instructions

In order to run the script tests, you first need to open up that specific file titled:

- CAS502Ingestion_UnitTest

The file was created using Colab. Therefore, to run the test file you need to open it in Colab. 
This can be done by selecting "Open in Colab" upon opening the file in the repository.

Before you run the test file, you will need to fill out the Production System Intake Form and save a local copy.
You can also just download the Production System Intake Example we have created on our repository to run the test.
If you choose to fill out an intake form yourself you can find help and instructions in the "Production System Intake Instructions."
